Breadth First Search (BFS)

BFS explores the graph level by level, starting from a source node:
- The starting node is at Level 0.
- Nodes at one edge distance are at Level 1.
- Nodes at two edge distance are at Level 2, and so on.

It travels breadth-wise — we explore all immediate neighbors before moving deeper.

📌 Uses:
- A queue (FIFO) to ensure nodes visited first are processed first.
- A visited array to prevent revisiting nodes.

⏱️ Time Complexity:
- O(V + E)
- Each node is visited once.
- Each edge is checked at most twice (in undirected graphs).
