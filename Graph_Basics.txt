Graphs – Basics

What is a Graph?

A graph is a collection of:
	•	Nodes (also called vertices)
	•	Edges (lines connecting pairs of nodes)

Minimum Condition for a Graph to Exist
	•	A graph must have at least one node.

⸻

Types of Edges
	1.	Directed Edge
	•	Represented with an arrow
	•	Allows one-way traversal
	•	Example: A → B (can go from A to B only)
	2.	Undirected Edge
	•	No arrow
	•	Allows two-way traversal
	•	Example: A — B (can go from A to B and B to A)

⸻

Example
	•	A tree is also a graph.
It is a connected, acyclic graph.

⸻

Cycles in a Graph

What is a Cycle?

A cycle exists when:
	•	You start at a node
	•	Traverse through one or more distinct nodes
	•	And return to the starting node

Note:
	•	At least one distinct node must be present between start and end.
	•	A direct self-loop does not count as a valid cycle in simple graphs.

⸻

Paths in a Graph
	•	A path is a sequence of nodes connected by edges.
	•	Adjacent nodes in the path must be joined by a valid edge.
	•	A path starts at one node and ends at another (or the same node, in the case of a cycle).

⸻

Degree of a Node

In an Undirected Graph:
	•	The degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it.
	•	Total degree of the graph = 2 × (number of edges)

In a Directed Graph:
	•	In-degree: Number of edges pointing to a node
	•	Out-degree: Number of edges pointing out from a node
	•	For the entire graph:
    .   Sum of all in-degrees + sum of all out-degrees = 2 × (number of edges)
