Connected Components in a Graph

A connected component is a subgraph in which:
	•	Every node is reachable from every other node within that component.
	•	There is no edge connecting nodes in different components.

⸻

Key Characteristics:
	•	The graph is divided into multiple smaller graphs called connected components.
	•	Nodes within a component are connected directly or indirectly through edges.
	•	There are no connections between separate components.

⸻

Traversal Implication:
	•	You cannot assume that starting DFS or BFS from one node will cover all nodes in the graph if the graph has multiple components.
	•	To handle this:
	•	Maintain a visited array or set.
	•	Iterate through all nodes.
	•	For each unvisited node, run a traversal (DFS or BFS).
	•	Each traversal will cover one entire connected component.
